## What is kubernetes :- 
-------------------
- Kubernetes is an open-source container management tool which automate container deployment, Container scaling and Load balancing.
- It schedules, runs and manages isolated containers which are running on virtual/physical/cloud machine.
- All top cloud providers support Kubernetes.

## History -
-------
- Google developed an internal system called Brog (later named as Omega) to deploy & manage thousands of google application and services on their cluster.
- In 2014, Google introduced Kubernetes an open source platform written in Golang language & later donated to CNCF.

## Online Platform for k8s -
------------------------
- Kubernetes playground
- Play with K8s
- Play with Kubernetes classroom

## Cloud based Kubernetes services -
--------------------------------
- GKE - Google Kubernetes services
- AKS - Azure Kubernetes services
- Amazon EKS - Elastic Kubernetes services

## Kubernetes Installation Tool -
-----------------------------
- Minikube
- Kubeadm
- Kind

## Problems with the scaling up the containers -
------------------------------------------------
- Container can not communicate with each other
- Autoscaling and load balancing was not possible
- Containers had to be managed carefully.

## Features of Kubernetes - 
----------------------
1. Orchestration (Clustering of any number of containers on different network)
2. Auto-scaling {Vertical(Scale up and down) and Horizontal (scale in and out) Scaling}
3. Load-balancing
4. Platform Independent (Cloud/Physical/virtual)
5. Fault tolerance (Node/POD failure)
6. Health Monitoring of Containers
7. Batch execution (One time, Sequential, Parallel)
8. Rollback (going to get back to previous version)

### Differences between Kubernetes and docker swarm

| FEATURES | KUBERNETES | DOCKER SWARM |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Installation and Cluster configuration | Complicated and time consuming | Fast and easy |
| Support | K8s can work with almost all containers type like rocket, Docker, Containers. | Work with docker only |
| GUI | Available | Not Available |
| Data Volume | Only shared within containers in same pod | Can be shared with any other container |
| Logging and Monitoring | Inbuilt tool present for monitoring | Used 3rd party tool like Splunk. |

- Apache Marathon - It is a container management tool. which has low market share. however, It is very important tool.

## Architecture of Kubernetes -
------------------------------

### Working with Kubernetes -
- We create a manifest (.yml)
- Apply this to cluster to bring it to desired state
- Pod runs on node, which is controlled by master

### Role of control plane/Master-node -
- Kubernetes cluster contains containers running on bare metal/ vm instances, Cloud instances/ all mix.
- Kubernetes designates one or more of these as master and all others as workers.
- The Master is now going to run set of k8s processes. 
- These processes will resume smooth functioning of cluster. 
- These processes are called ‚Äúcontrol plane‚Äù.
- Can be multi-master for high availability.
- Master runs control plane to run cluster smoothly.

### Components of Control Plane (Master Node):
1. Kube-API server
2. Etcd
3. Kube-scheduler
4. Controller manager

#### 1. Kube-API server (for all communications):
- This api-server interacts directly with user (i.e we apply .yml or json manifest to kube-apiserver).
- This kube-apiserver is meant to scale automatically as per load.
- Kube api-server is front-end of control-plane.

#### 2. Etcd:
- It stores metadata and status of cluster.
- Etcd is consistent and high available store (key-value store).
- Single Source of truth for cluster state (info about state of cluster).
- Etcd has following features: 
  - Fully replicated: the entire state is available on every node in the cluster.
  - Secure: implements automatic TLS with optional client-certificate authentication.
  - Fast: benchmarked at 10,000 writes per second.

#### 3. Kube scheduler:
- When users make request for the creation and management of PODs, Kube-scheduler is going to take action on these requests.
- Handles POD creation and management.
- Kube scheduler match/assign any node to create and run PODs.
- A scheduler watches for newly created PODs that have no node assigned. For every POD that the scheduler discovers, the scheduler becomes responsible for finding best node for that POD to run on.

#### 4. Controller Manager:
- Make sure that actual state of cluster matches the desired state.
- Two possible choices for controller manager:
  - If k8s on cloud, then it will be cloud-controller-manager.
  - If k8s on non-cloud then it will be kube-controller-manager

  Components on master that runs controller:
  - Node controller   : for checking with the cloud providers to determine of a node has been detected in the cloud after id stops responding.
  - Route controller  : responsible for setting up network, routes on your cloud.
  - Service controller: responsible for load balancers on your cloud against services of type load balancers.
  - Volume controller : for creating, attaching and mounting volumes and interacting with the cloud provider to orchestrate volume.

---

## Worker Nodes 
-------------
Node is going to run 3 important pieces of software/process. These 3 components collectively called NODE.
1. Kublet
2. Container engine
3. Kubeproxy

#### 1. Kublet:
- Agent running on the node.
- Listens to Kubernetes master.(e.g- POD creation request)
- Use port 10255.
- Send success/fail reports to master.

#### 2. Container Engine/Docker:
- Works with kublet.
- Pulling images.
- Start/stop containers.
- Exposing containers on ports specified in manifest.

#### 3. Kube-proxy:
- Assign IP to each POD.
- It is required to assign IP address to PODs (dymanic).
- Kube-proxy runs on each node and this make sure that each POD will get its own unique IP address.

---

## POD:-
-----
- Smallest unit in Kubernetes.
- POD is a group of one or more containers that are deployed together on the same host.
- A cluster is a group of nodes.
- A cluster has at least one worker node and master node.
- In Kubernetes the control unit is the POD, not containers. 
- It consists of one or more tightly coupled containers.
- POD runs on node which is control by master.
- Kubernetes only knows about PODs (does not know about individual container).
- Cannot start containers without a POD.
- One POD usually contains one container.

### Multi container PODs:
- Share access to memory space.
- Connect to each other using local host <container port>.
- Share access to the same volume.
- Containers within POD are deployed in an all-or-nothing manner.
- Entire POD is hosted on the same node (scheduler will decide about which node).

### POD limitations:
- No auto healing or auto scaling.
- POD crashes.

---

## Higher level Kubernetes objects:
- Replication set: auto scaling and auto healing
- Deployment: versioning and rollback
- Service:
- Static (non-ephemeral) IP and networking.
- Volume: non-ephemeral storage
